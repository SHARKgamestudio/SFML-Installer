# ðŸ“¥ SFML Installer
Ever wanted to start working with SFML but found the manual installation, linking, or using a package manager tedious?

Donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ve got you covered!

The SFML Installer provides a fully automated solution for setting up SFML with Visual Studio 2022. It handles everything from installing the library to setting up a pre-configured project template, so you can get started quickly and easily! :)

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to getting started with the SFML installer.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- First, head to the [**`releases`**](https://github.com/SHARKgamestudio/SFML-Installer/releases) section of this github repository.

- Run the exe. SmartScreen may warn it's dangerous, but it's notâ€”I just can't afford a Microsoft certificate.
